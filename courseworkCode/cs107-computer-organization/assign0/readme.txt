In the directory unixhunt/nums, there are two files full of numbers. Take a moment to look at the first and last few lines (using the Unix 'head' and 'tail' commands, respectively) to see for yourself (e.g., "head -20 nums1.txt").

The two files are identical except for the presence of one additional line in one that is not in the other. Find this line that is in one file and not the other and remember what number is written on that line (not the line number of the file, but the what is written there, which is a number). We'll call that number X. Now open the m_map.txt file that is in your cloned assign0 directory (alongside this readme.txt file), and write "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good" on line number X of that file. You should use your editor "protip" tricks to jump directly to line number X!

*Note*: When you submit your m_map.txt for grading, this text should be on line number X exactly, so double-check before submitting that you left it exactly there. 

Count how many times the number 111 occurs in the nums1.txt file. Write that number in response to the appropriate question above in this readme.txt file.

NOW RETURN TO THE ASSIGN0 WEB PAGE FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON THE NEXT ACTIVITY (intruder detection)!
